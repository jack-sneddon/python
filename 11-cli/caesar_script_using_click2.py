"""
    Adding some confidentiality (improved version of click)
    Our script arguments are supposed to be top secret messages that will 
    be encrypted. Isnâ€™t it ironic to ask the user to type his plain texts 
    directly in his terminal, leaving them in his commands history?

    A solution to do it in a more secure way is to use a hidden prompt. 
    
    Or we could read the text from an input file, which would be much 
    more practical for long texts. 
    
    Or why not let the choice to the user?
